## Activity & Growth Cycle Financing for Self-Actuating Communities

<img src="/assets/img/selfdriven-finance-activity-growth.png" style="border-radius: 12px; width:100%; max-width: 800px;">

**From Permissionless Capital to Purposeful Growth**

The **selfdriven.finance** model connects **Bitcoin (permissionless capital)** and **Cardano (permissionless DeFi)** to power **community-driven growth**.  
It channels long-term crypto capital into local, purpose-aligned initiatives — turning *yield* into *impact*.

### 1. Bitcoin Network → Permissionless Capital

Bitcoin holders form the foundation.  
By depositing BTC into **Taproot addresses**, they make their capital productive through **BitVMX** and **Cardinals** protocols.

*This converts idle BTC into collateral — enabling stable, interest-bearing lending and liquidity while preserving decentralisation.*

**Flow:**
- Bitcoin Holder → Taproot Address → Collateral Pool  
- Collateral backs DeFi loans and stable assets (e.g. USDM)  
- BTC remains verifiable and auditable on-chain  

### 2. Cardano Network → Permissionless DeFi

Cardano provides the programmable finance layer.  
Here, collateralised BTC supports **USDM** (provable, USD-backed 1:1) and related stablecoins.

These assets power:
- **Lending pools (P2P or perpetual)**  
- **Interest-bearing loans**  
- **Automated liquidation** (via on-chain lending protocols)  

*The Cardano extended UTxO model ensures every transaction is deterministic, auditable, and composable.*

If thresholds drop, collateral is sold, and bad debt is recorded on-chain — protecting solvency and preserving community reputation.

### 3. selfdrivenOS → Coordination & Trust

The `selfdrivenOS` layer (Organisational System) links financial flows to *human trust systems*.

It governs:
- **Allocation of funds** (who gets what and why)  
- **Voting, reputation & decision tracking**  
- **Interest & threshold maintenance**  
- **Identity verification via Verifiable Credentials**

`selfdrivenOS` ensures that community organisations and facilitators can coordinate transparently — embedding governance directly into the financing cycle.

*Every allocation, conversation, and decision builds verifiable trust.*

### 4. Communities → Activity & Growth

Funds flow into **Community Organisations** that drive real-world change:  
projects, education, health, sustainability, local enterprise, and more.

Facilitating organisations support this process by guiding:
- Project setup & governance  
- Marketing & awareness  
- Collaboration & skill sharing  

*Each completed project strengthens the community’s credibility and access to future capital.*

## 5. Accountability & Feedback Loop**

The cycle completes through **accountability proofs**.

When projects generate outcomes:
- Interest is paid to lenders  
- Collateral is released to Bitcoin holders  
- Results are verified and recorded on-chain  

If a default occurs:
- Collateral is liquidated  
- USDM debt is covered  
- The **Bad Debt Register** maintains integrity across lending pools

*This creates a self-correcting loop — aligning finance, governance, and reputation.*

### Outcome: Regenerative Finance**

Each cycle of *selfdriven.finance* strengthens two networks:

- **Bitcoin Network:** Stores and secures capital  
- **Cardano Network:** Executes programmable, verifiable community finance  

Together, they create a **regenerative economic engine** — where every transaction reinforces community resilience.

**Bitcoin provides the roots.**  
**Cardano grows the branches.**  
**Communities bear the fruit.**
